<h3>
1.3 Evolution of the Software Project Management Plan</h3>
<i>Describe how you expect this document

Chart" earlier in the document. The revision chart should list what has
already been done to this document. This section should list what is expected
to be done to this document.</i>
<p><i>This chart contains a plan for
the document�s revisions. The entries below are provided for purposes of
illustration. The progression from "Draft" to "Preliminary" to "Final"
and then through a section of "Revisions" is one typical approach.</i>
