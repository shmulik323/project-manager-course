1.Introduction</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.1Purpose
</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Identify
the product whose software requirements are specified in this
document, including the revision or release number. Describe the
scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if
this SRS describes only part of the system or a single subsystem.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.2Document Conventions</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Describe
any standards or typographical conventions that were followed when
writing this SRS, such as fonts or highlighting that have special
significance. For example, state whether priorities  for higher-level
requirements are assumed to be inherited by detailed requirements, or
whether every requirement statement is to have its own priority.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.3Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Describe
the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such
as developers, project managers, marketing staff, users, testers, and
documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains
and how it is organized. Suggest a sequence for reading the document,
beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the
sections that are most pertinent to each reader type.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.4Product Scope</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Provide
a short description of the software being specified and its purpose,
including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the
software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate
vision and scope document is available, refer to it rather than
duplicating its contents here.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">1.5References</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;List
any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These
may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system
requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and
scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could
access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version
number, date, and source or location.&gt;</I></P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__3_1154493965"></A>2.Overall
Description</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">2.1Product Perspective</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Describe
the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS.
For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a
product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new,
self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger
system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the
functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the
two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall
system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be
helpful.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">2.2Product Functions</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Summarize
the major functions the product must perform or must let the user
perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level
summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the
functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A
picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they
relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class
diagram, is often effective.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">2.3User Classes and Characteristics</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Identify
the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product.
User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset
of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege
levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent
characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain
only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user
classes for this product from those who are less important to
satisfy.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">2.4Operating Environment</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Describe
the environment in which the software will operate, including the
hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other
software components or applications with which it must peacefully
coexist.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">2.5Design and Implementation Constraints</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Describe
any items or issues that will limit the options available to the
developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies;
hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements);
interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and
databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements;
communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions
or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s
organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered
software).&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">2.6User Documentation</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;List
the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line
help, and tutorials) that will be delivered along with the software.
Identify any known user documentation delivery formats or standards.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">2.7Assumptions and Dependencies</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;List
any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the
requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or
commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the
development or operating environment, or constraints. The project
could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared,
or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external
factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from
another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for
example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).&gt;</I></P>
<H1 CLASS="western"><A NAME="__RefHeading__5_1154493965"></A>3.External
Interface Requirements</H1>
<H2 CLASS="western">3.1User Interfaces</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Describe
the logical characteristics of each interface between the software
product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI
standards or product family style guides that are to be followed,
screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g.,
help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error
message display standards, and so on. Define the software components
for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface
design should be documented in a separate user interface
specification.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">3.2Hardware Interfaces</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Describe
the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between
the software product and the hardware components of the system. This
may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and
control interactions between the software and the hardware, and
communication protocols to be used.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">3.3Software Interfaces</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Describe
the connections between this product and other specific software
components (name and version), including databases, operating
systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components.
Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going
out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed
and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe
detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data
that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing
mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of
a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this
as an implementation constraint.&gt;</I></P>
<H2 CLASS="western">3.4Communications Interfaces</H2>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;Describe
the requirements associated with any communications functions
required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network
server communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define
any pertinent message formatting. Identify any communication
standards that will be used, such as FTP or HTTP. Specify any
communication security or encryption issues, data transfer rates, and
synchronization mechanisms.&gt;</I></P>

Features</H1>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><I>&lt;This
template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the
product by system features, the major services provided by the
product. You may prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of
operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy, or
combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your
product.&gt;</I></P>
